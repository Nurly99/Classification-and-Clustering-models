•	Classification model: Built the kNN and SVM models that classify the data with an accuracy higher than 85%.  Trained, validated, and tested models using 80-20-20 data splitting and k-fold cross-validation. Tested several parameters to achieve higher performance. Used libraries: caret, kernlab, kknn, splitTools
•	Clustering model: Using the k means algorithm built a model that performs highly accurate clustering (89%). The elbow method was used to pick the k value where WCSS (sum of squared distance between the points and the center of cluster) starts decreasing. Used libraries: stats, factoextra, iris.txt dataset
